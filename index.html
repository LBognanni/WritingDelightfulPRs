## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write small PRs
_If you take one thing away from this presentation, please let it be this one_ üòÖ 

### Small PRs are:

![](big_pr.png)

- ‚úè Easier to write
- üëì Easier to review
- ‚úÖ Less risky
- üé† Give you a sense of momentum
- ü§´ _They also make you look better on your metrics!_

### How small is small enough?

- Smaller than you think
- One PR per Shortcut ticket
- Does your ticket contain a checklist? Congrats, each item becomes a new ticket
- `:it-depends-patrick:`

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Write small PRs


### Tops tips
 - üö© **Use feature flags**
    - pr `#1`: add feature flags
    - pr `#2..n`: add various bits
    - pr `#n+1`: remove feature flag
 - üìö **Stack PRs**
    - pr `#1` targets `main`
    - pr `#2` targets `feature_branch`
    - You can review & merge all the subsequent PRs, and then finally merge the feature branch to main
    - ‚ö† Careful with this, try not to have too many (>2) things open at once
 - ‚öî **Got a big PR to review?** 

     `Can we split this into smaller PRs?` is a completely fair request

### ü§† When to write large PRs 

- You're spiking something and pinky-swear to throw away the code when you're done
- You're doing some large automated refactoring that doesn't touch the logic (example, Use file scoped namespaces everywhere)

### üòà When (not) to write large PRs 

- CI takes forever? Large PR `*`
- Don't know what you're doing? Large PR
- Hate your reviewer? Large PR
- Want to look "busy" for days on end? Large PR
- Want to sneak in a security bug without noone noticing? Huuge PR

<br />

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make it easy to understand

#### You don't want to add friction to the review process!

- Reviewing PRs is hard work
- Reading code is harder than writing it
- You don't want to wait hours or days for a review
- "The reviewer" could well be future you!

    üí≠ Imagine: it's 2am and you're responding to an incident. You trace the bug to line 94 in `CalculationEngine.cs`. `git blame` says that PR `#3985` last touched that code. What would you like to see in that PR to help you get back to sleep ASAP?

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make it easy to understand

#### Top tips

- Use a sensible title for your PR

- Add a PR description
    - What is this PR doing?
    - Why are we doing it this way?
    - What are the risks? What are we doing to mitigate them?

- Link to your Shortcut ticket
    - It gives the reviewer more context about what this is and where it sits in the overall epic/milestone/sprint

- Assign yourself
    - It makes it easier to find _your_ PR!
